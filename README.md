Twitter Sentiment Analysis
This project focuses on classifying the sentiment of tweets as positive or negative using three machine learning models: Random Forest, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression. The dataset is preprocessed to clean the text, and feature extraction is done using TF-IDF.

After training and evaluating the models, the Random Forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 87%, making it the best-performing model for this task.

Models Used:
Random Forest (Best model with 87% accuracy)
Multinomial Naive Bayes
Logistic Regression
Feel free to explore the code and datasets provided to understand how sentiment analysis on Twitter data can be approached using different machine learning algorithms.
